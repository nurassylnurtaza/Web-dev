        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Bring to room temp!</strong> This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Pat dry</strong> and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get your skillet <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong> before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>WARNING:</strong> The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Take the steak off the stove <strong>BEFORE your desired internal temperature</strong> (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> <strong>REST</strong> your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</p>
