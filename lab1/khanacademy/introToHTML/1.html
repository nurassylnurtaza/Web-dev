         The Good Life
      </h1>
      <p>
         When some people talk about money <br>
         They speak as if it were a mysterious lover <br>
         Who went out to buy milk and never <br>
         Came back, and it makes me nostalgic <br>
         For the years I lived on coffee and bread, <br>
         Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday <br>
         Like a woman journeying for water <br>
         From a village without a well, then living <br>
         One or two nights like everyone else <br>
         On roast chicken and red wine. <br>
